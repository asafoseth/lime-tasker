A Personal Task Manager

## Overview

Welcome to **Task Manager**, a simple yet powerful web application designed to help you manage your daily tasks efficiently. Built with a modern and clean user interface, this application allows you to keep track of your tasks, mark them as complete, edit them, or remove them when no longer needed.

## Inspiration

In today's fast-paced world, staying organized and on top of your tasks is more important than ever.
